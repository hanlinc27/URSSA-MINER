# URSSA-MINER
 An autonomous, wireless soil sampling robotic arm. 
 
 ### Tech Stack 
 * Arduino Mega
 * C++
 * OpenCV 
 * Raspberry Pi
 * A lot of wires, stepper motors, and two servo motors
 
 ### Objective
 
This the code for the autonomous soil sampling robotic arm (jokingly nicknamed U.R.S.S.A. M.I.N.E.R) which allows for a user to select a point on the ground within a 1 metre radius through a GUI. From there, the robotic arm is able to move autonomously to pick up the soil and "sample" it through analyzing and returning values such as the mass, colorimetry, and soil density.
